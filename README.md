I decided to utilize machine learning and deep learning to try and see if its possible to achive a model that can understand and predict continuous house rent prices in Turkey.
1) I first made a webscraper that collects all the possible data I can get about each house for rent in Turkey via a website called https://www.emlakjet.com
2) the data contained a lot of missing, and non standeraized value so I tried to preprocess each data column accordingly
3) then made the following model:

Our model achieved a respectable 0.22 MSE

More about the model can be found the following presentation:
